# Reflux Marketplace
## What is Reflux?
Reflux ([here](https://github.com/frissyn/Reflux)) is a popular tool used by [Replit](https://replit.com) users to customize the IDE. 

## What is Reflux Marketplace?
Reflux Marketplace is a place where people can share the themes they make with each other, as well as use the Theme Generator without needing to learn the Python Package Syntax.

## Usage
There are 5 main parts to the site -
- Ability to share themes made with the package
- Admin support 
  - to help users change the screenshot, title, description, or author. All code is sanitized and verified by Admins before being made public.
- API
  - Feel free to use the Reflux Marketplace API to receive all of the data the marketplace holds in JSON format.
- Theme Generator 
  - Knowing Python is not necessary. With the theme generator, you can input colors, and the marketplace will run the package for you by converting your colors into hex codes. (i.e. black => #00000)
- A visual grid with all of the themes
   - The grid is highly responsive, and shows the following data - 
     - Name
     - Screenshot of theme
     - Author
     - Description
     - JS Code
     - Tampermonkey Script
